      question: "What is a measured building survey?",
      answer:
        "A measured building survey is a precise recording of an existing building’s geometry and features. It captures internal and external dimensions, levels, openings, structural elements and fixed services so architects and engineers can work from an accurate “as-built” model.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why do I need one?",
      answer:
        "It’s vital for design, renovation, or legal documentation, ensuring that your plans match the true dimensions of your property.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take?",
      answer:
        "Typical residential/small commercial buildings: 1–3 days on site and 2–7 days processing. Large or complex buildings (multi-storey, industrial): longer. We give a timeline in the quotation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need revisions after receiving the survey?",
      answer:
        "Minor clarifications are included. For additional site visits or major changes, we provide a costed revision on request. We aim for clarity at handover to minimise rework.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started and what’s the lead time?",
      answer:
        "Contact us with project details (address, building size, purpose of survey). For standard projects we commonly schedule within 1–2 weeks; busy periods vary—confirm during enquiry.",
    },
